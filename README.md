I love to work in Python, Java and Javascript. However, I am constantly learning new tools and can use whatever is needed for the job.

I am finding great interest in technologies that allow different pieces of software/hardware to talk to one another. Therefore I am building a strong understanding of API development, front / back end communication, and database retrieval.

I love jamming to drum/bass electronic music while I code, and my dog in my lap!
